# AI Travel Planner - Product Roadmap

## Product Description

The AI Travel Planner is an intelligent travel planning application that helps users create personalized travel itineraries with AI assistance. The key features include:

1. **AI-powered travel planning**: The application uses OpenAI's API to generate travel recommendations, itineraries, and respond to user queries about travel destinations.

2. **Interactive chat interface**: Users can communicate with an AI travel assistant through a chat interface to express their travel preferences and get personalized recommendations.

3. **Dynamic itinerary creation**: The app allows users to create, view, and manage detailed travel itineraries with day-by-day activities.

4. **User preferences management**: The application captures user preferences like travel style, budget, dietary restrictions, and interests to personalize recommendations.

5. **Location-based services**: Integration with Google Maps and TripAdvisor services to provide real-world data for attractions, restaurants, and other points of interest.

6. **Authentication and user accounts**: Users can create accounts and save their travel plans using Supabase for the backend.

7. **Mobile-responsive design**: The UI is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, including components from Radix UI for a responsive experience across devices.

The application follows a modern React architecture with TypeScript for type safety. It uses React Context for state management and integrates with external APIs for AI (OpenAI), maps (Google Maps), and travel information (TripAdvisor). The backend is powered by Supabase for authentication and data storage.

## Product Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (1-2 Weeks)
**Objective**: Establish the foundation for development, including architecture, API integrations, and database setup.

#### Define Tech Stack and Architecture (2-3 Days)
- Database: Supabase integration
- APIs:
  - OpenAI API for generating recommendations and natural language processing.
  - Google Maps API for location data, addresses, and mapping features.
  - TripAdvisor API for activity, restaurant, and accommodation recommendations.

#### Set Up API Integrations (3-4 Days)
- Create API keys for OpenAI, Google Maps, Supabase, and TripAdvisor
- Write wrapper functions to handle API calls (e.g., fetchRestaurantsFromOpenAI, getLocationFromGoogleMaps, fetchActivitiesFromTripAdvisor).
- Test API connectivity and handle rate limits/errors (e.g., implement retry logic for failed API calls).
- Cache API responses (using Redis or local storage) to reduce redundant calls and improve performance.

#### Database Schema Design (2 Days)
- User Schema: Store user details (ID, name, email, preferences like travel style, budget, activity interests).
- Itinerary Schema: Store trip details (ID, userID, destination, start/end dates, day-by-day activities).
- Activity Schema: Store activity details (ID, itineraryID, day, time, type [e.g., food, activity], name, address, description).
- Use indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., userID, itineraryID) for faster retrieval.

#### Set Up Version Control and CI/CD (1 Day)
- Use Git for version control (GitHub/GitLab).
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment to a staging environment.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Development (4-6 Weeks)
**Objective**: Build the core features: AI chat assistant, itinerary builder, and activity card updates.

#### Build the Itinerary Sidebar and Activity Cards (1.5 Weeks)
- **Itinerary Sidebar**:
  - Create a React component for the sidebar that displays the trip name, dates, and day-by-day breakdown.
  - Use a dropdown or tabs to switch between days (e.g., "Day 1: Wed, Apr 30").
- **Activity Cards**:
  - Build a reusable ActivityCard component with fields for time, type (food/activity), name, address, and description.
  - Add edit/delete buttons on each card (icons for pencil and trash can).
  - Use drag-and-drop functionality with a library like react-beautiful-dnd to allow users to reorder activities within a day.
- **Rendering**:
  - When the AI generates an itinerary, populate the sidebar by mapping the itinerary JSON to ActivityCard components.
  - Ensure the date display is correct by parsing the startDate and calculating subsequent days (e.g., new Date(startDate).toLocaleDateString()).

#### Develop the Chat Interface with AI Assistant (1.5 Weeks)
- **Chat UI**: Use React to build the chat interface, with a message input field and scrollable chat history.
- **AI Integration**:
  - Integrate OpenAI API to process user prompts (e.g., "Plan a trip to New York City from May 1 - 4, 2025").
  - Parse user input to extract key details (destination, dates, preferences) using OpenAI's natural language understanding.
  - Example prompt to OpenAI: "Generate a 4-day itinerary for New York City from May 1-4, 2025, focusing on sightseeing and food."
- **Response Handling**:
  - Convert OpenAI's response into a structured itinerary format (e.g., JSON with days, activities, times, descriptions).
  - Example structure:
    ```json
    {
      "destination": "New York City",
      "startDate": "2025-05-01",
      "endDate": "2025-05-04",
      "itinerary": [
        {
          "day": "Day 1: May 1, 2025",
          "activities": [
            { "time": "8:00 AM", "type": "food", "name": "Breakfast at Katz's Delicatessen", "address": "205 E Houston St", "description": "Enjoy a classic NY breakfast." },
            { "time": "10:00 AM", "type": "activity", "name": "Walk in Central Park", "address": "Central Park, NY", "description": "Visit Belvedere Castle." }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
- **Error Handling**: If the AI fails to parse dates or destinations, prompt the user for clarification (e.g., "I couldn't understand the dates. Could you specify them again?").

#### Enable Itinerary Updates via Chat (1 Week)
- **Update Logic**:
  - Parse user requests like "Change Thursday's dinner to 8pm" using OpenAI to identify the day, activity, and new time.
  - Update the corresponding activity in the database and re-render the activity card.
  - Example: If Thursday is May 1, 2025, find the "dinner" activity (e.g., by type "food" and time slot) and update its time field.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or React state to update the UI in real-time when the itinerary changes.
  - Example: After updating the dinner time, dispatch a Redux action to refresh the itinerary sidebar.
- **Validation**:
  - Check for time conflicts (e.g., if another activity is already at 8pm, notify the user: "There's a conflict with another activity at 8pm. Would you like to proceed?").

#### Implement Itinerary Saving (0.5 Week)
- **Save Functionality**:
  - Add a "Save" button that sends the current itinerary to the backend via a POST request to /api/itineraries.
  - Store the itinerary in the database under the user's ID.
- **Retrieve Functionality**:
  - On app load, fetch the user's saved itineraries (GET /api/itineraries?userId=<userId>) and display them under "My Trips."
  - Allow users to load a saved itinerary by clicking on it, populating the sidebar.

### Phase 3: Onboarding & Preferences (2 Weeks)
**Objective**: Build the onboarding flow to capture user preferences and enhance AI recommendations.

#### Develop Onboarding Flow (1 Week)
- **UI**: Use React to create a multi-step form with sections for Profile, Travel Style, Activities, Preferences, and Budget.
- **Form Fields**:
  - Activities: Checkboxes for Sightseeing, Food & Dining, Relaxation, etc.
  - Travel Style: Dropdown (e.g., Solo, Family, Adventure).
  - Budget: Slider or input field (e.g., $500-$2000).
- **Save Preferences**:
  - Store user preferences in the database under the user's profile.
  - Example schema update:
    ```json
    {
      "userId": "123",
      "preferences": {
        "activities": ["Sightseeing", "Food & Dining"],
        "travelStyle": "Solo",
        "budget": 1000
      }
    }
    ```

#### Integrate Preferences into AI Recommendations (1 Week)
- **Modify AI Prompts**:
  - Include user preferences in OpenAI prompts. Example: "Generate a 4-day itinerary for New York City from May 1-4, 2025, for a solo traveler who enjoys sightseeing and food, with a budget of $1000."
- **Fallback Recommendations**:
  - If OpenAI doesn't return enough activities, use TripAdvisor API to fetch additional recommendations based on preferences (e.g., GET /tripadvisor/activities?location=NYC&category=food).
- **Location Enrichment**:
  - Use Google Maps API to fetch accurate addresses for activities (e.g., GET /maps/api/geocode/json?address=Katz's Delicatessen, NYC).

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (2-3 Weeks)
**Objective**: Fix past issues, test functionality, and prepare for deployment.

#### Fix Past Issues (1 Week)
- **Itinerary Creation/Updates**:
  - Ensure the AI correctly parses dates by using a library like date-fns to validate and format dates (e.g., parse("May 1 - 4, 2025", "MMM d - d, yyyy", new Date())).
  - Test edge cases (e.g., "Plan a trip from tomorrow to next week").
- **Activity Card Updates**:
  - Debug the chat bot's ability to update activity cards by logging parsed intents and ensuring database updates reflect in the UI.
  - Example: If the user says "Change dinner to 8pm," log the parsed intent ({ day: "Thursday", activity: "dinner", newTime: "8pm" }) and verify the update.
- **Date Display**:
  - Standardize date formats across the app (e.g., "Wed, Apr 30") using date-fns or Moment.js.
  - Ensure the AI's date parsing aligns with the display format.

#### Testing (1 Week)
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test API wrappers (e.g., mock OpenAI responses to ensure itinerary generation works).
  - Test itinerary updates (e.g., simulate a "change dinner time" request).
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test end-to-end flow: user input → AI response → itinerary generation → sidebar rendering.
  - Test API integrations (e.g., mock Google Maps responses to verify address fetching).
- **UI Tests**:
  - Use Cypress or Jest to test drag-and-drop functionality and activity card rendering.
  - Test responsiveness across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

#### Performance Optimization (0.5 Week)
- Optimize API calls by caching responses (e.g., cache TripAdvisor results for 24 hours).
- Lazy-load activity cards to improve sidebar rendering speed.
- Compress images (e.g., destination thumbnails) to reduce load times.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (1 Week)
**Objective**: Deploy the app and set up monitoring to catch issues early.

#### Deploy to Production (2 Days)
- Deploy the app to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Vercel).
- Set up environment variables for API keys and database credentials.
- Configure a domain and SSL for secure access.

#### Set Up Monitoring & Logging (2 Days)
- Use a logging tool (e.g., Winston or Sentry) to track errors (e.g., failed API calls, itinerary update failures).
- Monitor performance metrics (e.g., response time for itinerary generation) using a tool like New Relic.
- Set up user feedback forms to capture issues (e.g., "Report a Problem" button).

#### Post-Deployment Testing (1 Day)
- Test the live app with real user scenarios (e.g., plan a trip, update an activity, save an itinerary).
- Fix any critical bugs identified during testing.

## Rules for Developers

### Code Quality
- Follow clean code principles (e.g., DRY, single responsibility principle).
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Write comments for complex logic (e.g., date parsing, API response parsing).

### Error Handling
- Always handle API errors gracefully (e.g., if TripAdvisor API fails, fall back to OpenAI recommendations).
- Show user-friendly error messages (e.g., "I couldn't fetch activities right now. Let's try something else!").
- Log all errors to the backend for debugging.

### Performance
- Limit API calls by caching responses where possible.
- Avoid overfetching data (e.g., only fetch activities for the current day being viewed).
- Use pagination for large itineraries (e.g., load 10 activities at a time).

### Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., use a library like sanitize-html).
- Store API keys in environment variables, not in the codebase.
- Use JWT for user authentication and secure itinerary access.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all critical functions (e.g., itinerary generation, activity updates).
- Test edge cases (e.g., invalid dates, API downtime).
- Perform manual testing after each major feature implementation.

### UI/UX Consistency
- Match the provided UI designs (e.g., chat bubble styles, activity card layouts).
- Ensure responsiveness across devices (use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or media queries).
- Keep date formats consistent (e.g., "Wed, Apr 30" everywhere).

### Documentation
- Document API endpoints (e.g., /api/itineraries for saving itineraries).
- Write a README with setup instructions, dependencies, and deployment steps.
- Document any workarounds for past issues (e.g., date parsing fixes).
